            <h3>Front End and Back End Developer</h3>
            <p>I am a fresh graduate of Computer Science and Engineering but in my university courses project I have
                tried
                to explore my knowledge by working in different fields like app development, website development, ML
                projects, etc using PHP-MySQL, HTML,CSS, JavaScript. Also i have a knowledge of C,C++, Python
                programming
                Language . I found my top interest in Web site development and Machine Learning and I have completed
                many
                courses on Coursera and started to gain my skill by learning and working on these two fields by doing
                many
                research papers and projects. I have already worked on NLP also. Now I am looking for an entry-level
                position to kick start my career and to join a company that can help me in enhancing my skills,
                strengthening my knowledge, and realizing my potential especially in Software Development which will
                contribute to my professional and personal growth along with the organization goals
